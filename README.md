Prevent armor stand movement to improve performance

This *requires* Paper as we need to use their new armor stand movement API.

This can result in massive performance wins when there are large amounts of armor stands,
since armor stand movement can take up a lot of CPU time.
This is the official replacement for the TacoSpigot option to optimize armor stand movement
and is now usable even on a 'normal' Paper server thanks to their new API.
